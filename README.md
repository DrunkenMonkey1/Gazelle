## Installation
See the script in `.vagrant/gazelle-setup.sh` to get a gist of what needs to be done to install Gazelle on Debian
Jessie. You should be able to modify this to whatever distro you want to run it on.

## Logchecker
To fully utilize the Logchecker, you must install the following depedencies through pip:
* chardet
* eac-logchecker
* xld-logchecker

## Gazelle Development
This repository comes pre-setup to be run through [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) for ease of development and 
without having to modify your local machine. You can look through the docs for how it works, but to start, you
just need to download Vagrant and VirtualBox (and it's recommended to get the 
[vagrant-vbguest](https://github.com/dotless-de/vagrant-vbguest) plugin) and then simply run:
```
vagrant up
```

This will build a Debian Jessie on a Virtual Machine and serve this repository through `/var/www` on the machine. It
will also forward the following ports:
* 8080 -> 80 (nginx)
* 36000 -> 3306 (mysql)
* 34000 -> 34000 (ocelot)

You can access the site by going to `http://localhost:8080`
